# INFO branch X01BD kernel
* current active branch : qk/20200711/ul qk/20200711/l qk/20200711/n
# INFO about kernel
* P = Kernel for Android 9 (Pie) ROMs and Official ArrowOS (both Android 9 & 10 ArrowOS)
* Q = Kernel for Android 10 (Q) ROMs and Stock ROM (both Android 9 & 10 Stock ROM)
* uL = 1.95 Ghz CPU + 585 MHz GPU Kernel + Undervolted (for battery backup)
* L = 2.2 GHz CPU + 585 MHz GPU Kernel + Undervolted (for balanced battery backup and performance)
* N = 2.2 GHz CPU + 585 MHz GPU Kernel + Little/No Undervolt (for performance)
* 60 Hz, 65 Hz, 71 Hz = Refresh rate variants of same kernel. 
# Notes
* (60 Hz & 65 Hz is supported by almost all display panels. So, you can use as per your choice. 71 Hz is supported by very less display panels and you might get freeze issues. If you get freeze issues on 71 Hz kernel then switch to 60/65 Hz kernel. More refresh rate means more smoothness and more battery usage)
* DTC, GCC, Stormbreaker, Avalon, Proton etc. are different tools to compile kernels, you can find more about them by Google Search. Which one is better? - Try them and find out yourself.
* If you are getting issues like freeze, random shutdown, random reboot with UV kernels like 'uL' & 'L' version then don't use these kernels. Instead use 'N' version.
